## Web Scripts

A collection of extremely simple scripts built to solve specific problems
in web development scenarios.

Each script is independent and unrelated to the others.

Includes:

   * `sendmail.php`: (Yet another) mail delivery script for contact pages
   * `mysqldump.php`: A stand-alone mysql backup dump generator using PHP
   * `pear_mail`: A drop-in replacement for PHP's built-in mail() function
